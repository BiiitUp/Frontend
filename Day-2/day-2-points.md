    HTML links are hyperlinks.
    You can click on a link and jump to another document.
    When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

    Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red
